Start
Set i = 0
While i < 15, do the following:
    Set j = 0
    While j < 15, do the following:
        //calculate the row distance from the center of the rows
        Set num = 7 - absolute value of (7 - j)
        //calculate the column distance from the center of the columns
        Set num2 = 7 - absolute value of (7 - i)
        //if sum of two distances is less than or equal to 7 print 
        If num + num2 is less than or equal to 7, then print the character represented by the ASCII code (num + 65) followed by a space
        // else print space 
        If num + num2 is greater than 7, then print two spaces
        Increment j by 1
    Move to the next line by printing an endline character
    Increment i by 1
End.
